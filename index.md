### About Me
I am currently obtaining an electrical engineering degree from the University of Pittsburgh. In my spare time, I like to work on projects, big and small. I am passionate about engineering both in academics and as a hobbyist. This passion has led me to create many things from my imagination as well as re-create projects made by other passionate engineers. I have managed to develop many hands-on skills throughout these projects, including soldering, CAD designing, CNC machining, and 3D printing. 
<br>
Ever since I was young, I was facinated with how things work. Over my childhood, I spent my time taking many things apart and then figuring out how they go back together (or not). My fascination has grown to many aspects of engineering, which is reflected in these projects. They cover software, mechanical, and electrical engineering, and sometimes all of those aspects in one project. I have had so many learning experiences while doing each and every one of these projects, which I think is the key to success. This project library is meant to show the trials and tribulations I have faced, as well as the experience and knoweledge I have gained throughout the duration of the projects.

### Project Library

---

Below is a list of projects with a short description and a link to a dedicated project page. Each individual page will include my thought process throughout the project and a gallery of photos to show them off. There is also a link to return back to this home page. Please check out the projecects that interest you!

#### Volumetric Display
This project is my most recent, but also my longest running project by far. This volumetric display project was inspired by science fiction films (Iron Man in particular)
as well as personal interest. This project has been a huge learning experience, and it is most likely the best documented project on this site, so please take a look!

#### 2048 Game
I created this game as a gift to my fiancee, but I have adapted it to be more suitable for a professional portfolio. This game was coded in javascript and HTML, where I was actually able to apply a lot of what I learned in my first year of college. This project is the only one that doesn't follow the dedicated project page concept. This link will take you straight to the game where you can try and reach the 2048 tile to win, best of luck!
