### About Me
I am currently obtaining an electrical engineering degree from the University of Pittsburgh. In my spare time, I like to work on projects, big and small. I am passionate about engineering both in academics and as a hobbyist. This passion has led me to create many things from my imagination as well as re-create projects made by other passionate engineers. I have managed to develop many hands-on skills throughout these projects, including soldering, CAD designing, CNC machining, and 3D printing. 
<br>
#### Purpose
Ever since I was young, I was facinated with how things work. Over my childhood, I spent my time taking many things apart and then figuring out how they go back together (or not). My fascination has grown to many aspects of engineering, which is reflected in these projects. They cover software, mechanical, and electrical engineering, and sometimes all of those aspects in one project. I have had so many learning experiences while doing each and every one of these projects, which I think is the key to success. This project library is meant to show the trials and tribulations I have faced, as well as the experience and knoweledge I have gained throughout the duration of the projects. This library is also meant to serve as a professional portfolio for myself as well as an inspirational/learning tool for other makers like me.

### Project Library

Below is a list of projects with a short description and a link to a dedicated project page. Each individual page will include my thought process throughout the project and a gallery of photos to show them off. There is also a link to return back to this home page. Please check out the projecects that interest you!

#### Volumetric Display
This project is my most recent, but also my longest running project by far. This volumetric display project was inspired by science fiction films (Iron Man in particular)
as well as personal interest. Volumetric displays can be implemented in different ways, this one in particular uses the swept volume approach to create a surface that you can project light onto that has a true 3-dimensional viewing experience. This project has been a huge learning tool, and it is most likely the best documented project on this site, so please take a look!

#### MIDI Launchpad
I made this MIDI controller for a group of friends that created their own podcast. To control the playing of sound effects and other sound bytes, I made a "launchpad" which is just a matrix of led-backlit pushbuttons to which you can program the starting of any sound file you might have.

#### RGB Acrylic Sign
I've always wanted to make an edge lit acrylic sign. This was also made for my friend's podcast. What's cool about this project is that everything I used to create this sign was leftover from other old projects. If there is one thing I enjoy most, it is repurposing things that originally have nothing to do with the end result. If you like this sign, checkout the designs I laser engraved into cutting boards in the next description.

#### Engraved Cutting Boards
Customized cutting boards are a big ticket item currently. A friend of mine actually makes the wooden boards himself and I engrave them for him. If you're interested and want to know more, check out this project page as well as my friend's website (link coming soon)!

#### Force Indentation Machine
As a student at the University of Pittsburgh, I've had the pleasure of working under a chemical engineering professor, creating an assortment of laboratory tools and equipment. This project was very complex in nature, it involved using a very high-resolution optical sensor capable of measuring linear travel at micron resolution! This project is based off an arduino (like most of my other projects) and it acts as a middle-man between a user interface run in Java on a computer and the arduino that samples the optical sensor. This project page has a lot of cool and interesting concepts on how a force indentation machine works in general, which I think is really cool too.

#### Motorized Stretching Machines
Stepper Motors! This project was a first for myself trying to control stepper motors with an arduino microcontroller. Its actaully pretty starightforward, and fun to do as well. Utilizing some powerful motors and drivers, I created another laboratory tool for researchers at Pitt to use as a stretching apparatus. I've made multiple revisions including a high-power version that is still used today.

#### CNC Iron Man Helmet Keychain
If you couldn't figure it out just yet, I am a huge fan of the Iron Man movies and Marvel in general. To pay tribute to the cool tech in the movies, I decided to create a keychain out of aluminum of Iron Man's helmet. This keychain project improved my design and manufacturing skills greatly, you'll learn a lot when milling aluminum on a desktop CNC machine.

#### 2048 Game
I created this game as a gift to my fiancee, but I have adapted it to be more suitable for a professional portfolio. This game was coded in javascript and HTML, where I was actually able to apply a lot of what I learned in my first year of college. This project is the only one that doesn't follow the dedicated project page concept, but this link will take you straight to the game where you can try and reach the 2048 tile to win, best of luck!

#### Bluetooth Speakers
Who doesn't like a good bluetooth speaker project, because I have more than 4 separate speakers I have created over the years. This project page is home to all of the different builds and revisions I have done. So if you're a fan of music or some quality craftsmanship (and some not-so quality), check out this page.

#### Diy Class D Amplifier
To go along with the bluetooth speakers above, I have made two separate attempts to create my own amplifier. Neither of my attempts turned out to work all that well, but I did learn a lot. My second attempt was for a school project that worked slightly better.

#### 8-Bit Breadboard Computer
Long before I took a class in digital logic, myself and a friend set out to create our own breadboard computer. The end goal was to have this computer add and subtract small numbers and display them on a 7-segment display. Although this end goal was never reached, we did make a good amount of progress on the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) portion of the computer.

#### Batting Cage - Eagle Scout Project
I am proud to say that I completed my Eagle Scout project and earned the rank of Eagle Scout in the summer of 2017. This project page is dedicated to showing off the batting cage I made with the help of my fellow Boy Scouts. Check this out!

#### Binary Clock
This project is a first for creating my own PCB. I used a homeade method for etchcing a copper board with vinegar and salt after applying an ink transfer from the printed circuit on paper. The result was an Attiny microcontroller-based clock that gave the time in a binary format.

#### Radio Transmitter Signal Processor
The first documented project I have created is a crude attempt at a signal processor/mixer for a robotics competition in high school. One of the keys to success in a battlebots competition is the driving. To be a good driver, the controller needs to be responsive and intuitive. The robot we were running was all-wheel drive and the controls weren't very straightforward as is, so I created a circuit based on the Atmega328 to do some signal processing.
