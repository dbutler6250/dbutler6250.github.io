                        <h3>Stretching Jigs - Low and High Power</h3>
                        This was another project I created while working for a research position at school. The photo gallery shows off a few versions of the stretching apparatuses
                        I created to satisfy the needs of some researchers. While I wasn't very involved in the applications of what I created, I did learn a lot as this was one of my first projects for 
                        the research position.

                        This project was pretty simple. I was tasked with creating a jig that can stretch samples via counter-rotating shafts. I accomplished this via two stepper motors with corresponding mounts,
                        the associated stepper drivers, and an Arduino microcontroller to tie everything together. As I said, there are a few versions of the device, mostly because the applications required more and more stretching power.
                        To accomodate that requirement, I utilized higher power drivers and motors. To control the motors, I created an easy to use interface within the Arduino program to allow for process variables to be changed quickly.
